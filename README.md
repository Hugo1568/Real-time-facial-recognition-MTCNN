# Real-time-facial-recognition-MTCNN

This project was made with the objective of detecting each computer science student at the University of Sonora in Hermosillo Sonora.

NOTE: The files recFacesCAM.ipynb and recFacesVideo.ipynb are the files that work, the rest of the files are from tests that we did while developing this project.
